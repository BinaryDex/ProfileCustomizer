### How Do I Use Extra Pins?
In the text below you will find a part where it says `?username=BinaryDex` replace 'BinaryDex' with your GitHub username. Next, find the part where it says `&repo=ProfileCustomizer` replace 'ProfileCustomizer' with your github repo name you want to pin. Also make sure to change the username and repo name at the end of the text too! Finally, at the near the end you will see `&show_owner=true` you can change it to 'false' if you don't want the card to show the repo owner's name or 'true' if you do.
